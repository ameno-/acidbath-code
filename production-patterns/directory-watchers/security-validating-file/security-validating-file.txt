Never execute code from dropped files directly. Treat all input as untrusted. Validate, sanitize, then process.

## The Automation Decision Framework

Not every task deserves automation. Use specific thresholds.

| Frequency | ROI Threshold | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Once | N/A | Use chat |
| 2-5x/month | > 5 min saved | Maybe automate |
| Weekly | > 2 min saved | Consider zone |
| Daily | > 30 sec saved | Build zone |
| 10+ times/day | Any time saved | Definitely zone |

| Complexity | Time to Build | Approach |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Single step | 5 minutes | Bash agent |
| Multi-step | 30 minutes | Python agent |
| AI reasoning | 15 minutes | Claude agent |
| Mixed flow | 1-2 hours | Chain agents |
| Needs approval | 2-3 hours | Approval workflow |

| Risk Level | Requirements | Safety |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Low | None | Full auto |
| Medium | Logging | Auto + audit |
| High | Review | Approval required |
| Critical | Sign-off | Manual only |

**Real numbers from our deployment:**
- Morning meeting transcription: 10x/week, saves 15 min/day, ROI: 2.5 hours/week
- Code review: 30x/week, saves 3 min each, ROI: 1.5 hours/week
- Data analysis: 5x/week, saves 20 min each, ROI: 1.7 hours/week
- Legal contract review: 2x/month, approval required, ROI: 40 min/month

Total time saved: 22 hours/month. Setup time: 8 hours. Break-even in 2 weeks.
